# Machine learning
## Introduction
Practices of machine learning.

- Strategy
    - Loss function => Cost function
    - Experience Risk -> Expectation Risk
    - Structural Risk = Experience Rist + Regularization
    - k-fold cross validation
    - feature standardization
- M.L Algorithm
    - Linear
    - Decision Tree
    - Naive Bayes
    - Support Vector Machine
    - Clustering
    - Neural Network => Deep Learning
    - Ensemble Learning
    - Reinforcement Learning
- Optimization
    - Gradient descent
    - Newton method
    - Lagrange duality
    - Kernel method

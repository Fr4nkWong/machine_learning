# Machine learning
## Introduction
Practice of machine learning.

- Strategy
    - Loss function => cost function
    - Experience Risk -> Expectation Risk
    - Structural Risk = Experience Rist + Regularization
    - k-fold cross validation
- Algorithm
    - Model
        - Linear
        - Decision Tree
        - Naive Bayes
        - SVM
        - Clustering
        - Deep Learning
        - Ensemble Learning
        - Reinforcement Learning
    - Optimization
        - Gradient descent
        - Newton method
